# Mortgage Plan Analyzer

This Laravel project, developed as part of [SUSE Hack Week 23](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/23/projects/mortgage-plan-analyzer), is a collaborative effort aimed at simplifying the analysis of housing loan proposals, with a focus on common configurations in Portugal.

## Overview

The Mortgage Plan Analyzer focuses on analyzing proposals that typically have two phases: an initial fixed-rate phase followed by a variable phase composed of a contracted spread and variable Euribor. This project aims to streamline and clarify the financial decision-making process for common housing loans in Portuguese territory.
